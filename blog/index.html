The article is from <strong>phys.org</strong> and was written by <strong>Andrew Martin</strong>. <p>Due to the spread of the new coronavirus, online learning for school students is increasing. In order to remedy this, the educational psychologist who wrote this article, propose five key considerations for educators : Instruction, Content, Motivation, Relationships, Mental Health. <ol><li><strong>Instruction</strong> </ol> <p>Regarding the principles of Load Reduction Instruction, online lessons must be very clear and well-structured, delivered in little chunks.

The teacher have to be sure to use the best material in order to provide the most comfortable lesson to the students. Also, it is important that the content is not too difficult too soon in order to not confusing the student early in the learning process. <ol start=3><li><strong>Motivation</strong> </ol> <p>There is one area of motivation particularly relevant to online learning: self-regulation which is represented in the Wheel by self- and task-management, planning, and persistence. <ol start=4><li><strong>Relationships</strong> </ol> <p>Concerning this point, in an online environment, it is recommended that teachers maintain contact with the class in different ways, for instance : via email, the school's online learning platform, video, blogs, and class chat-groups. <ol start=5><li><strong>Mental Health</strong> </ol> <p>If mental health hurts, learning usually suffers. As a result, it is important that all students are clearly informed of who to contact inside or outside the school if they are in difficulties. <p><a href=https://phys.org/news/2020-03-optimize-online-age-coronavirus.html>https://phys.org/news/2020-03-optimize-online-age-coronavirus.html</a></div> <div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=/blog/mathematicians-develop-new-theory-to-explain-real-world-randomness/>Fast Share, Android&#039;s answer to Apple&#039;s AirDrop</a> </h1> <span class=post-date>26 Feb 2020</span> <p>The article deal with the possibility of sharing files between Android products easily.

Indeed, it can keep students from understanding the main content. <p>These so-called &quot;seductive details,&quot; information that is interesting but irrelevant, can be detrimental to learning by the look to a meta-analysis by Washington State University researchers published in the journal Educational Psychology Review recently. <p>This result was obtained by cross-referencing 58 studies and is as follows: People who learned with seductive details performed lower on learning outcome measures than those who learned without them. <p>Finally, that doesn't mean the course doesn't have to be cool, but just make a little more effort to think about how we can make the learning activity itself much more appealing and interesting, according to Sundar., <p><a href=https://phys.org/news/2020-03-seductive-inhibit.html>https://phys.org/news/2020-03-seductive-inhibit.html</a></div></div> </div>
