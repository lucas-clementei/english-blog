The article deal with the solutions to optimize online learning with a five key. The article is from **phys.org** and was written by **Frank Mols, Gary Mortimer And Jonathan Roberts.** 

AI is everywhere, music and video streaming services, online shoppings etc... As a result, why not use artificial intelligence to suggest whom we should vote for ?

The article identify two types of voters : the one who back the same party since a long time and the other, the "swinging voters" who compare options before making a choice. 

Moreover, we can see thet politicians already use AI to target us.In the same way businesses use retargeting strategies to persuade us to buy or act, politicians now do the same.

If politicians are using AI to try to persuade us how to vote, why not flip this around and give us the AI tools needed to help us decide how to vote?

In our side, the voters, there are already a few tools to guide us, but nothing really advanced today
