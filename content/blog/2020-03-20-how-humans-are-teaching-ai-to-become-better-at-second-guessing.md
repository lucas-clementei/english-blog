The article is about how could the AI helps humans and what means are use to develop this. The article is from **techxplore.com** and was written by **Lachlan Gilbert.**

Dr.Yao highlights the fact that IA reacts after a given situation. Throughout the article, Dr.Yao will explain the future of AI and how it should anticipate our intentions, not wait for a given situation. 

The analyze of gestures, eye movement, posture, facial expression and even micro-expressions could be used to improve intent prediction. 

Afterall, if we can predict intent, the IA could be a real help for decision support. Especially in critical situations.

As an example, in a rescue situation, an AI system can be used to help rescuers take the optimal strategy to locate a person or people more precisely. Such a system can use localization algorithms that use GPS locations and other data to pinpoint people, as well as assessing the window of time needed to get to someone, and making recommendations on the best course of action.
