The article is about extra-pair paternity in an African society. The article is from **phys.org** and was written by **Jessica Wolf**.

A study from UCLA professor of anthropology Brooke Scelza made on an African society "The Himba" shows that the rate of extra-pair paternity found among Himba is 48% exceed the 1% to 10% range previously thought to be typical for humans. The "extra-pair paternity" refers to an instance in which a child is born to a married couple, but the husband is not the biological father.

The researcher contends that men not only are aware of this pattern, but they also have a system of social norms that support this practice. This research provides a new perspective in the study of human reproduction.
