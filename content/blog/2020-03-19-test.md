The article deal with the positive use of seductive details for learning. The article is from **phys.org** and was written by **Sara Zaske**.

All goes with a funny thing such as a cat video or even background music. Indeed, it can keep students from understanding the main content.

These so-called "seductive details," information that is interesting but irrelevant, can be detrimental to learning by the look to a meta-analysis by Washington State University researchers published in the journal Educational Psychology Review recently.

This result was obtained by cross-referencing 58 studies and is as follows: People who learned with seductive details performed lower on learning outcome measures than those who learned without them.

Finally, that doesn't mean the course doesn't have to be cool, but just make a little more effort to think about how we can make the learning activity itself much more appealing and interesting, according to Sundar.,
